# An analysis of three Deep Learning models using MNIST database

An analysis of three deep learning methods in the realm of computer vision. This includes Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). The dataset used for the analysis is MNIST. Each model is created based on the above mentioned methods and trained using the original MNIST dataset, or after it
has undergone some sort of preprocessing. The behavior of each of them are tested using data not encountered before during training, such as a noisy test set, and the observations noted.
The response of these models to pure noise data are also going to be recorded. We will attempt to look for bias in predictions for models trained with various combinations of training and test
data sets. Finally, we will come to some conclusions regarding the properties of each of these Deep Learning methods with respect to the MNIST dataset.
